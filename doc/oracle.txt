To connect to Oracle DBMS of the ITMO university the following steps are required:
1. Make an OpenVPN connection to the ITMO university subnetwork using script file from the bin/ folder 
2. Run a Oracle SQLDeveloper [1] and use the following credentials to create a connection:
login: ISU_SEMANTIC
pass: fltu1632
service name: oracis
host: 192.168.1.2
port: 1521 (Oracle DB default)

As alternative it is possible to use the Oracle SQLPlus command line interface [2]:
sqlplus64 ISU_SEMANTIC/fltu1632@192.168.1.2:1521/oracis

For jdbc connectivity use oracle:thin client (ojdbc6.jar) [3]
jdbc string is: "jdbc:oracle:thin:ISU_SEMANTIC/fltu1632@192.168.1.2:1521:oracis"

In case of error messages like "Invalid date" during the queries, check the ENV variable to be set according to the locale used inside the Oracle RDBMS.
export NLS_LANG=RUSSIAN_RUSSIA.CL8MSWIN1251
Or set it inside the SQLDeveloper interface in the preferences section.
