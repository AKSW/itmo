To work with Oracle DBMS Sparqlify implemented a new adapter due to proprietary extensions of the SQL language (i.e. ROWNUM).

To get Sparqlify working with the Oracle DBMS the running command should be changed from:
#java -cp "/usr/share/lib/sparqlify-cli/sparqlify-cli.jar" org.aksw.sparqlify.web.Main "$@"
To
java -cp "$PATHTOOJDBC/ojdbc6.jar:/usr/share/lib/sparqlify-cli/sparqlify-cli.jar" org.aksw.sparqlify.web.Main "$@"

To process the mapping run the script from the bin/ folder
Or use one-liner:
sparqlify -D -U ISU_SEMANTIC -W fltu1632 -j jdbc:oracle:thin:ISU_SEMANTIC/fltu1632@192.168.1.2:1521/oracis -m mapping.sml
